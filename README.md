### Hello Cyb Safe! 

It was pleasure to work with pokemons :) 
I was able to implement the following in the discussed time frame: 

1. Fetch data from API 
2. Display pokemons info & details on the main page
3. Add a filter form and filter pokemons
4. Add basic styling so the view doesn't look too bad (but it isn't perfect)

Things I didn't have time for as per time limit: 
1. Individual page view (I would use react router and either use <Link> or useNavigate to navigate to different route).
2. Unit test: I am comfortable working wiht Jest and Enzyme. I would test the Pokemon and Pokemons components, specifically I would mock the fetch API call and filter option. I would also add snapshot testing. 

## I hope to hear from you!
